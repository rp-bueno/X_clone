<h2 id="started">üìå About </h2>

This project is a front-end clone inspired by the social platform X (formerly Twitter).
The main goal was not to create an identical visual copy, but to develop a functional user flow, including authentication and page redirection features.
It was a valuable opportunity to practice and reinforce key web development skills.

Features

‚úÖ Login System with username and password authentication (stored in localStorage)
‚úÖ Home Page accessible only after successful login
‚úÖ Dynamic Redirection: unauthenticated users are automatically redirected back to the login page
‚úÖ Logout Button that properly clears the session and redirects to the login page
‚úÖ Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for better code organization

‚ö° Important Note:
This project does not prioritize security best practices ‚Äî login credentials are visible in the code and localStorage is used for simplicity and learning purposes.

Learning Highlights

    Managing user authentication and sessions with localStorage

    Dynamic page redirection based on authentication status

    DOM manipulation and event handling

    Structuring a multi-page front-end project with good practices
